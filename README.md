# BlockingOperation
A silly Minecraft bot that works by taking screengrabs and using image manipulation to find out what's happening, then directly sending mouse movements/keyboard events to Minecraft to bot in a nearly undetectable way.

It's terrible and everything's hardcoded, and it probably wont work for anyone but me, but it was fun to make.
